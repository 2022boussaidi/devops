**DevOps Practical Exam**

### Overview:

Welcome to the DevOps Practical Exam! Your task is to establish a fully automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Spring Boot application hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/HamzaGbada/mongo-demo). This practical exam will assess your ability to leverage Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes or OpenShift, and SonarQube to enhance the development, testing, and deployment processes for the given Spring Boot application.

### Instructions:

1. **Version Control:**
    - Clone the Spring Boot application from the provided [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HamzaGbada/mongo-demo).

2. **Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins:**
    - Set up a Jenkins pipeline that triggers on each code commit.
    - Configure Jenkins to clone the repository, initiate the build process, and execute automated tests on the Spring Boot application.

3. **Dockerization:**
    - Implement a Docker build step within the Jenkins pipeline to create container images from the Spring Boot application.
    - Push the built Docker image to a private Docker registry to securely manage and store container images.

4. **Private Registry Authentication in Jenkins:**
    - Configure Jenkins to authenticate and securely pull the Docker image from the private registry.
    - Implement proper authentication mechanisms to ensure secure retrieval of container images during the deployment process.

5. **Database Connectivity with Docker Compose:**
    - Utilize Docker Compose to define and manage a multi-container Docker environment.
    - Set up a Dockerized environment that includes the Spring Boot application and a MongoDB database.
    - Implement data persistence for MongoDB using Docker Compose to ensure that data is preserved across container restarts.
6. **Container Orchestration with Kubernetes or OpenShift:**
    - Integrate either Kubernetes or OpenShift into the pipeline for container orchestration.
7. **Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube:**
    - Incorporate SonarQube into the Jenkins pipeline for continuous code quality assessment.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Document your progress in a step-by-step guide, including configuration files, scripts, and commands used.
- Provide explanations for your choices and any challenges faced during the implementation.
- Include screenshots or outputs demonstrating the successful execution of each step.

Good luck! Your goal is to demonstrate a robust and efficient CI/CD pipeline that ensures the seamless integration, testing, and deployment of the Spring Boot application while maintaining code quality and security.
