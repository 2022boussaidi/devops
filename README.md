****Instructions:
Version Control:

1/Clone the Spring Boot application from the provided GitHub repository.
Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins:

2/Set up a Jenkins pipeline that triggers on each code commit.
Configure Jenkins to clone the repository, initiate the build process, and execute automated tests on the Spring Boot application.
Dockerization:

3/Implement a Docker build step within the Jenkins pipeline to create container images from the Spring Boot application.
Push the built Docker image to a private Docker registry to securely manage and store container images.
Private Registry Authentication in Jenkins:

4/Configure Jenkins to authenticate and securely pull the Docker image from the private registry.
Implement proper authentication mechanisms to ensure secure retrieval of container images during the deployment process.
Database Connectivity with Docker Compose:

5/Utilize Docker Compose to define and manage a multi-container Docker environment.
Set up a Dockerized environment that includes the Spring Boot application and a MongoDB database.
Implement data persistence for MongoDB using Docker Compose to ensure that data is preserved across container restarts.
Container Orchestration with Kubernetes or OpenShift:

5/Integrate either Kubernetes or OpenShift into the pipeline for container orchestration.
6/Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube:

Incorporate SonarQube into the Jenkins pipeline for continuous code quality assessment.
