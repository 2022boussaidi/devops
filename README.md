# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive DevOps pipeline for a Spring Boot application, including version control, continuous integration, Dockerization, database connectivity, container orchestration, and code quality analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Kubernetes or OpenShift
- SonarQube
- MongoDB

## Version Control

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Cloned the Spring Boot application from the provided GitHub repository.

## Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins

2. **Jenkins Pipeline Setup**:
   - Set up a Jenkins pipeline that triggers on each code commit.
   - Configured Jenkins to clone the repository, initiate the build process, and execute automated tests on the Spring Boot application.

## Dockerization

3. **Docker Build Step**:
   - Implemented a Docker build step within the Jenkins pipeline to create container images from the Spring Boot application.
   - Pushed the built Docker image to a private Docker registry to securely manage and store container images.

## Private Registry Authentication in Jenkins

4. **Registry Authentication**:
   - Configured Jenkins to authenticate and securely pull the Docker image from the private registry.
   - Implemented proper authentication mechanisms to ensure secure retrieval of container images during the deployment process.

## Database Connectivity with Docker Compose

5. **Multi-Container Environment**:
   - Utilized Docker Compose to define and manage a multi-container Docker environment.
   - Set up a Dockerized environment that includes the Spring Boot application and a MongoDB database.
   - Implemented data persistence for MongoDB using Docker Compose to ensure that data is preserved across container restarts.

## Container Orchestration with Kubernetes or OpenShift

6. **Orchestration Integration**:
   - Integrated Kubernetes or OpenShift into the pipeline for container orchestration.

## Code Quality Analysis with SonarQube

7. **Code Quality Assessment**:
   - Incorporated SonarQube into the Jenkins pipeline for continuous code quality assessment.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   

2. **Start the Jenkins pipeline**:
   - Ensure Jenkins is running and the pipeline is configured as described.

3. **Access the application**:
   - The Spring Boot application will be running on the configured port.
